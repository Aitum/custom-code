# custom-code

Getting started with Custom Code in Aitum!

# About

This repo is a starting point for Custom Code (aka CC) in Aitum, which gives users the ability to add in functionality that we currently don't provide natively.

# Resources

Below are resources for each language that are provided to interface with Aitum.

If you are new to programming, we recommend using Javascript/Typescript resources to get you started.

## Javascript & Typescript

### aitum-cc
Aitum-CC is our first-party wrapper to remove the need for custom implementation to start writing your own CC Actions.

If you're new to programming or just want to experience the best level of integration with Aitum, this is for you.

### aitum.js
Aitum.JS is our first party API wrapper. It provides access to all supported devices directly, alongside various other parts of Aitum's ecosystem.

You can also register CC actions using aitum.js, but the process is a lot more involved and we strongly advise using [aitum-cc](https://github.com/aitum/aitum-cc) instead.
